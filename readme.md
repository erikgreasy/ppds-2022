# Class 6 - H20 synchronization problem
This class is oriented in solving H20 synchronization problem, where multiple threads are running acting as hydrogen or oxygen molecules. The problem is that we need to combine 2 hydrogens with one oxygen to create H20 molecule as expected.

## Run the program
To run the program, execute following command:
